                        <p class="description">This creamy coffee drink is usually consumed at breakfast time in Italy and is loved in the United States as well.

                        <p class="description">Cafe lattes are considered an introductory coffee drink since the acidity and bitterness of coffee are cut by the amount of milk in the beverage. Flavoring syrups are often added to the latte for those who enjoy sweeter drinks.</p>

                        <p class="description">The cafe au lait is typically made with French press coffee instead of an espresso shot to bring out the different flavors in the coffee. It is then paired with scalded milk instead of steamed milk and poured at a 50/50 ratio.</p>
